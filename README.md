  # Erick Manrique
  Hello, World! I'm a student of General Assembly's SEI program! This README.md us outdated and will shortly be updated! 
  <br>
  
  I aspire to be at least a front-end developer by July 2021. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack Software Engineer, as soon as mentally possible. It's very inspiring to me to think I may end up writing programs for companies like NASA, Tesla, Apple, or maybe even developing high-quality games for a company like EA. 
  <br>
  
  I might have a long way to go but I've already made a dent and I am not finished. 
  <br>
  
  If you are an aspiring software developer who's in the same boat as me <b> or </b> you're here to professionally assess me, please reach out so we can learn, build your business, or do both together!
