# Erick Manrique

### Who Am I?
I'm a student of General Assembly's Software Engineering program where I'm learning the MERN-stack, with a hint of Rails at the end. The proximity of cities with skylines like NYC & Miami has always kept my ambitions high. 4 passionate years in restaurants have kept me busy. Together, they've provoked a natural curiosity for testing humanity's limits while providing for it.
<br/> 
### Personal Brand & Goals
This led me to General Assembly! Where I'm currently learning MERN and only getting started on the fast track to sky-high goals at revolutionary companies like Tesla, NASA, Apple, etc.  Now I live on my laptop while I daydream about safari's and going to the moon.
  <br/>
  
  ### Tl;dr
  I'm a nerd at heart with a huge passion for human evolution, space, and nature.
