<em>Day (4) of 100 Days of Code!</em>
<br>
  
  Welcome to my gitHub! 
  <br>
  
  A quick about me:
  I am a 21 year old, self-taught, junior web-developer based in Hollywood, Florida. I almost signed up for a bootcamp with a $30k ISA... but I realized the learning format was simliar to self-teaching & I believed in myself. 
  <br>
  
  I aspire to be at least a front-end developer by July 2021. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack Software Engineer. It's very inspiring to me to think I may end up writing programs for companies like NASA, Tesla, Apple, or maybe even developing high-quality games for a company like EA. 
  <br>
  
  I might have a long way to go but I've already made a dent and I'm not finished. 
  <br>
