## Who Am I

Hello world! I am a full-stack developer with a strong background in hospitality where I learned the importance of collaboration, commmunication, and keeping your cool under pressure. I started my journey in March 2021 by self-teaching, full-time, web fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and JS. By May, I had at least 4 websites built with just HTML/CSS and an additional 5 that leveraged the DOM & jQuery to make the UI interactive!

In May 2021, I decided to enroll in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive where I learned how to build applications with MERN and React on Rails, accelerating my growth as a developer through 600+ hours of hands-on projects:

In September 2021, I was invited to become a part of GA's instructional team. This meant that I would solidify my understanding of full-stack concepts by mentoring 20+ students per cohort as they went through the program. Beside mentoring, my other responsibilites included the creation & delivery of lectures on DSA's as well as reviewing the code for each student's nightly homeworks & monthly projects.

Along the way I freelancecd for an NYC-based startup, where I integrated Segment as an analytics engine, made styling & funcitonal updates to their Next.js UI, and even had my first interaction with bash scripting by automating the process of updating local environment variables!

## What I'm Working on

I am now a DevOps engineer at MarketAxess where I am the subject matter expert for Rundeck, a tool created to automate operational tasks. By implementing Rundeck as a developer self-service center, my team's workload progressively gets lighter as we identify & automate frequently requested tasks from developers, directly improving their velocity as well.

On the weekends, I lead a cross-functional team of UX designers and Engineers to create a mobile application called [Bootcamper](https://github.com/yeezick/Bootcamper). Our goal is to create a networking that newly graduated bootcamp graduates can use to connect with other designers and engineers over the premise of a project. This presents both roles with a simulated professional working environment as they learn to collaborate with each other and build an application out of willpower instead of Youtube tutorials.
We follow Scrum methodology (something I learned at MarketAxess), visualized by Jira, to delegate tasks, organize our epics, and plan our 3-week sprints. In a way, we are our first users and plan on sharing our experience with our users to help them hit the ground running! We meet weekly on Mondays and are looking to expand our team, feel free to message me if you're interested in accelerating the average bootcamper's graduate-to-hire timeline!

  ### Tl;dr
  I'm a nerd at heart with a huge passion for human evolution, space, & nature. It's only the beginning of my lifelong venture to build & work for companies that are passionate about revolutioninizing technology and the everyday human experience. I live on my laptop while I daydream about safaris & going to the moon (literally)!

 <small><b> The most important thing I have left to tell you is to wish you a good day. It doesn't hurt to be positive and I'm certain you deserve it. </b> </small>
