  # Hello World
  My name is Erick Manrique & I'm currently a student at General Assembly's Software Engineering course.
  <br>
  
I'm Full-Stack software developer, specializing in MERN with a hint of Rails. The proximity of cities with skylines like NYC & Miami has always kept my ambitions high. 4 passionate years in restaurants have kept me busy. Together, they've provoked a natural curiosity for testing humanity's limits while providing for it. 
<br> 
This led me to General Assembly! Where I'm currently learning MERN and only getting started on the fast track to sky-high goals at revolutionary companies like Tesla, NASA, Apple, etc. Now I live on my laptop while I daydream about safari's and going to the moon. 
  <br>
  
  #### tl;dr
  I'm a nerd at heart with a huge passion for human evolution, space, and nature.
  
  If you are an aspiring software developer who's in the same boat as me <b> or </b> you're here to professionally assess me, please reach out so we can learn, build your business, or do both together!
